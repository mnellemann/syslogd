# Syslog Daemon

Basic syslog server written in Java. All received messages are written to *stdout*.

The syslog server is able to listen on UDP and/or TCP and parses syslog messages in either RFC5424 or RFC3164 (BSD) format. The default syslog port (514) requires you to run syslogd as root / administrator. If you do not with to do so, you can choose a port number (with the -p flag) above 1024.

## Usage Instructions

- Install the syslogd package (*.deb* or *.rpm*) from [downloads](https://bitbucket.org/mnellemann/syslogd/downloads/) or compile from source.
- Run *bin/syslogd*, use the *-h* option for help :)
